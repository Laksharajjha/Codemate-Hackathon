Project Overview:
I have built a fully-featured, web-based terminal using Python and Flask that meets all mandatory and optional requirements.

Backend: The application logic is split into command_logic.py for processing shell commands and app.py for handling web requests. The project is started via the required main.py entry point.

Frontend: The user interface is a clean, responsive terminal created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, located in the templates folder.

Features:

AI-Powered Queries: Connects to the OpenRouter API to translate natural language into commands. The API key is securely managed via a .env file.

Command History & Autocomplete: Implemented in the frontend JavaScript.

System Monitoring: A custom status command shows CPU and memory usage.

Development Process:
I used the CodeMate IDE's AI assistant extensively to help scaffold the code, generate functions, and debug issues throughout the development process, as required by the hackathon rules
